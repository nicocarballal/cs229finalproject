## Alternate Storage
Although we are using Github, I am hosting my personal code on OneDrive so I can access it on different machines more easily if necessary. If you ever need to reference a database, this is an option: https://office365stanford-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nicocarb_stanford_edu/EnoyOlXcvZhHknDO4vzYG3EB0L3BvW_imMp1UWwwT8Y8Cw?e=jDkxcC

If you only want to access the sample data, I am hosting a lot of that on Google Drive. This all might be useful when we are training in the Cloud: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZiSPSyJ3x64-90pS2R2O5-5ofC7CTu-s?usp=sharing
## History
10/24 --> Run the Global Fire Atlas Demo in the Jupyter Notebook 
10/27 --> Run the Global Fire Atlas Demo w/ visualization nicer
10/31 --> Run Global Fire "Topological" Demo to show how to filter data
10/31 --> Create data_set_creator.py and util.py to start filtering our data for the United States

## Data
Currently, the only data is from [Global Fire Atlas](https://www.globalfiredata.org/). The data in the data folder is from December 2020 (and the .ipynb notebook pulls from that)
